            This blog is where I like to share my local food reccomendations. I am student at the
            University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It is my second year and I had recently found
            that people have been enjoying my reccomendations so I thought to make them public!

            Don is a Japanese restaurant with simple seating on Tate Street. It is open 11am-10pm on most days
            of the week.

          <p class="blog_text">
            Don specializes in Teriyaki, Donburi, and Ramen. Having been there I must say my favorite thing on the menu
            is actually their curry! Japanese curry is far different to Indian curry as it is significantly less hot,
            instead airing on the side of sweetness. The curry has been my favorite but it is closely followed up by
            the Shoyu Ramen and the Don Katsu Don.
